# Data Wrangling Tutorial

As someone who is getting prepared to become a Data Analyst, I believe practice is the best way for learning. In this small tutorial I go through importnat steps and use crucial Pandas and Numpys functions. I believe these functions and data wrangling techniques are a must know for anyone looking to work as a data analyst/scientist.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle. It is about obesity among adults by country, 1975-2016.

Hope you find it helpful and happy learning!
